## Investigation into reinforcement learning algorithms
### Study into GA, ES, & DQN

This repo contains the source code used for my recent Masters project undertaken at the University of Reading.

Please see each folder for a guide on each method and how to run them:

[DQN](./drl) Deep Q-Network, developed by DeepMind

[GA & ES (GPU)](./ga-es_gpu) Genetic Algorithms and Evolution Strategies, developed by Uber AI Labs and OpenAI respectively. This folder holds the GPU version of these two methods (created by Uber AI Labs).

[GA & ES (Distributed)](./ga-es_dist) Genetic Algorithms and Evolution Strategies, developed by Uber AI Labs and OpenAI respectively. This folder holds the distributed version of these methods which was used only in the initial phases of this project.
